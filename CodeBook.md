# Coursera - Get and Cleaning Data with R
## Final Assignment

# CodeBook
obs. this codebook describes only the modifications made on the original dataset

## mergeData.txt dataset
- it has 10299 lines and 563 columns
- it merges the training (X_Train.txt) and test (X_Test.txt)
- all 561 columns from both original datasets are in mergeData
- all lines from both original datasets were added in mergeData
- two new columns [1:2] were added
  . 1. Subject - contains the subject id from subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt
  . 2. Activity - contains the activity description label for the activity code from y_test.txt and y_train.txt
- all 561 columns merged were named using the label from feature.txt
  . obs. feature.txt has some duplicated labels <-bandsEnergy()-xx,yy>. As I donÂ´t know why they created it that way, I opted to not try to resolve this, even when aggregate() removed them during the averageData construction.

## averageData.txt dataset

## run_analysis.R

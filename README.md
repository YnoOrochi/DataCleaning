# Coursera - Get and Cleaning Data with R
## Final Assignment

# README

## Submited files
* README.md - this file, with basic description of the files in the repository
* CodeBook.md - a basic description on the operations and modification on the original dataset
* run_analysis.R - the R script used to modify the original dataset

## Created datasets
* mergeData.txt - a new dataset that merges X_Test.txt, X_Train.txt and their labels
* averageData.txt - a data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

# Original files
## base directory
* README.txt - main information about the UCI HAR Dataset and the test/train selection
* activity_labels.txt - description labels for the Activity variable
* feature.txt - labels for 561 variables on the Test and Train dataset
* features_info - basic description for the original 561 variables on the dataset

## ./test directory
* subject_test.txt - id for the subject who measured each line of data
* y_test.txt - activity being performed on each line of data
* X_test.txt - test set derived from the measured data
* Inertial Signals - subdirectory with the axial measured data from the accelerometer

## ./train directory
* subject_train.txt - id for the subject who measured each line of data
* y_train.txt - activity being performed on each line of data
* X_train.txt - test set derived from the measured data
* Inertial Signals - subdirectory with the axial measured data from the accelerometer
